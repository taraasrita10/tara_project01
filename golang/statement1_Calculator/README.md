# Calculator

This is a simple calculator built in Go. It takes two operands and an operator as input, and gives the result as output. The program functions as a loop, continuously taking user input until the user opts not to continue.

## Tests

The test file covers different kind of testcases, covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negative calculations, division by zero and invalid operators.

## Usage

To run the main program
```bash
go run main.go
```

To run the tests
```bash
go test -v
```

## My Learning

While the main program is relatively simple, it was an efficient way to understand how Go supports testing, how to write these testcases and was a good way to sharpen up my syntax.
